Demo of latest Datasette with the latest version of every plugin

This repository deploys a demo of the latest `main` branch of Datasette plus every plugin listed in [plugins.txt](plugins.txt) once per day.

That demo lives here: https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/ - see https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/-/plugins for a list of installed plugins.

This is intended to help spot compatibility problems between new versions of Datasette and its plugins, and also highlight any plugins that conflict with each other.
